        <p> Sneaker People collaborates with Chilean muralist Mono Gonzalez to imagine a jogger inspired by the street art of Valparaiso. <br><br> 
        Home to a  multi-generational graffiti movement, Valpo's 43 "Cerros" (hilly neighborhoods) are tapestries of murals and mosaics. In designing his own sneaker, Mono captures the aesthetics of these urban-scapes with iconic local flair.<br><br>
        Beloved across Chile for their robust colors and flowing lines, Mono's works carry unrivaled panache. His signature style appears in the Dia's striking red accents and radical silhouette. With its distinct shape, the artist wanted to represent the progressive attitudes of the city's next generation of creatives, which he hopes to inspire with the Dia's youthful attitude. <br><br>
        The Buen Dia will be available in San Francisco stores and online 12/1/2019
