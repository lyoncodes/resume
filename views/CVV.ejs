      I have experience coordinating year-round marketing strategies focused on digital media outreach and targeted social media content. Through effective market research,
      While managing large-scale construction improvements I displayed aptitude for coordinating communications between vendors and clients, effectively conveying progress towards milestones while helping align stakeholdersâ€™ expectations. I drafted and edited internal and external communications in the planning and execution of $40K in countertop replacements, $15K in commercial security upgrades, and $400K in structural repairs following building floods.
      Most recently, I have completed courses in web development using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I am familiar with mobile-first design, responsive layout, and meta- data analytics, with experience creating full-stack web applications.
